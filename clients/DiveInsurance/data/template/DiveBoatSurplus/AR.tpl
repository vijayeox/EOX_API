“THIS CONTRACT IS REGISTERED AND DELIVERED AS A SURPLUS LINE COVERAGE
UNDER THE SURPLUS LINES INSURANCE LAW, AND IT MAY IN SOME RESPECTS BE
DIFFERENT FROM CONTRACTS ISSUED BY INSURERS IN THE ADMITTED MARKETS, AND,
ACCORDINGLY, IT MAY, DEPENDING UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BE MORE OR LESS
FAVORABLE TO AN INSURED THAN A CONTRACT FROM AN ADMITTED CARRIER MIGHT
BE. THE PROTECTION OF THE ARKANSAS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY GUARANTY ACT
DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT. A TAX OF FOUR PERCENT (4%) IS REQUIRED TO
BE COLLECTED FROM THE INSURED ON ALL SURPLUS LINES PREMIUMS.”
