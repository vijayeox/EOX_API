            <div style='line-height: 24px'>Dear {$firstname} {$lastname}, <br/>
                <p>Your PADI-Endorsed insurance expired on June 30, {$expiry_year} at 12:01 AM. To renew without a lapse in coverage, we must receive your renewal application by July 10, {$expiry_year}. Please apply online at <a href = "https://www.diveinsurance.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" style = "color:blue;"><u>www.diveinsurance.com</u></a> or contact us at 1.800.223.9998 or 1.714.739.3177 for a new application.</p><br/>

                <p>Please remember, your policy is a "Claims Made" policy which means you are only covered if you have continuous coverage when the alleged negligent act took place, through when a claim against you. You can protect yourself by buying "Non-Teaching/Supervising Instructor" or "Retired" coverage. This Extended Reporting Period costs ${$cost} for 12 months until June 30, {$expiry_year}.</p><br/>

                <p>If you have recently submitted an application, and have confirmation it was received by us, it is currently being processed and you may disregard this email.</p>
