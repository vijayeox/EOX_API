```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```
### Note 1: If you followed docker-ompose approach mentioned above, then you need to follow the scripts mentioned below
### Note 2: if you start application using docker-compose at root level, then you have to update crdential only in .env file at root level, but if you run each application separately by entering into services, then update .env at respective places.
